Natural Language Processing with Python

This project focuses on preprocessing text data using natural language processing techniques. 
It involves cleaning and tokenizing text, creating unigram lists, and handling unknown words by replacing low-frequency words with a placeholder token.

Project Description

The project includes the following main steps:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing non-alphabetical characters and converting text to lowercase.
Tokenization: Adding start and end tokens to each sentence and splitting them into individual words.
Unigram Model Creation: Generating a list of unigrams (individual words) from the tokenized text.
Unknown Word Handling: Replacing words that appear less than five times with a special token ($unk) to handle unknown words.
